Student Grade Tracker Project Overview
1.Objective:

The goal of this project is to create a Python program that allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments.
It calculates the average grade, assigns a letter grade, and computes the GPA (Grade Point Average).
2.Features Implemented:

User inputs grades for six subjects (English, Maths, Science, Social, Physics, and Biology).
The program calculates the average grade using the provided grades.
It assigns a letter grade based on the average.
It converts the average grade to GPA using predefined ranges.
3.Components:

Input Collection: The program prompts the user to input grades for each subject.
Average Calculation: It computes the average grade across all subjects.
GPA Calculation: It converts the average grade to GPA using predefined ranges.
4.Additional Information:

The program displays the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
It also calculates the percentage based on the average grade.
5.Next Steps:

You can further enhance the program by adding features like weighted grades, student names, and a graphical user interface (GUI).
